This range is quite broad due to the significant variation in entry-level opportunities.\n* \n* **Mid-Level (2-5 years experience):** PKR 150,000 - 350,000 per month. This range reflects increasing responsibility and expertise.\n* \n* **Senior-Level (5+ years experience):** PKR 350,000+ per month.  Salaries at this level can go much higher depending on leadership responsibilities and the specific industry.\n* \n* \n* **Important Considerations:**\n* \n* * **These are estimates:**  Actual salaries can vary considerably.\n* * **Location matters:** Major cities like Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad generally offer higher salaries.\n* * **Company size and industry:** Multinational corporations and tech companies tend to pay more than smaller organizations.\n* * **Skills and expertise:**  Specialization in areas like machine learning, deep learning, or specific industry applications can command higher salaries.\n* * **Negotiation:**  Salary is often negotiable, and candidates with strong skills and experience can leverage their expertise to secure better compensation.\n* \n* \n* It's recommended to consult job boards specific to Pakistan (like Rozee.pk, Indeed Pakistan, etc.) and research individual company salary data to get a more accurate understanding of current market rates.
